# mini-message-board

This Mini Message Board project was built for The Odin Project’s Node.js curriculum to practice the basics of Express.js. I created a simple server with routes for viewing messages and for submitting new ones, storing submitted messages in an array. The app uses EJS to render dynamic views, follows the POST, Redirect, and GET pattern, and includes basic validation to prevent empty submissions. Overall, this project helped me learn how to set up an Express app, handle routes, and use GET and POST methods to handle user inputs and display the data dynamically.
